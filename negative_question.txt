I am easily annoyed and dissapointed
If someone makes a mistake that I benefit from, I don't correct them
I feel stressed when under pressure
I often play a role in order to impress people
I have difficulty starting tasks
I tend to always see the good in people, no matter what the circumstance is
I lack self-discipline
I tire quickly
